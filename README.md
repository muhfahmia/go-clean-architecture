## Go Clean Architecture Boilerplate

A scalable and modular Golang project boilerplate built with Clean Architecture principles. Designed to separate concerns across layers — domain, usecase, interface, and infrastructure — this boilerplate promotes maintainability, testability, and clear boundaries between business logic and external dependencies.


### Features

- Layered architecture (domain-driven design)
- Dependency inversion and interface-based contracts
- Middleware-ready HTTP server (Fiber)
- Configurable environment management
- Repository pattern for database abstraction
